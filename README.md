# CNN_Dogs-vs-Cats_Image_Classification

This repository contains all the code and results for my course project on dogs and cats image recognition.

## 1. Installation

This project is written in Python and uses Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda. The following Python libraries are required for the project:

- `os`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`

## 2. Project Motivation

This project is a capstone project for my Machine Learning/Deep Learning course.

In this project, I will build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train on a dataset containing 4000 dog images and 4000 cat images. The model will then be tested on a dataset with 1000 dog images and 1000 cat images. Finally, images from the `single_prediction` folder will be used as input for the model to predict and classify them as either a dog or a cat.

## 3. Dataset
